# 请介绍下你的爱好

One of my favorite hobbies is traveling. I enjoy exploring different cities and cultures, whether it’s a historical town or a modern metropolis(məˈtrɒpəlɪs). Traveling helps me relax and recharge, especially after intense periods of study or work. I have traveled to many places within my country, but unfortunately, I haven’t had the chance to visit abroad yet.



# 介绍下你的优缺点

**Strength:**
 I believe my greatest strength is persistence. I’m able to stay committed to a goal even when faced with setbacks or when the progress is slow. I don’t give up easily. I know that meaningful results take time, and I’m not afraid of putting in long-term effort.

**Weakness:**
 One weakness I’ve become more aware of is that I can sometimes become overconfident when I achieve quick results or perform well in a task. While confidence is important, I’ve realized that staying humble is just as critical for long-term growth. I'm working on reminding myself to keep learning from others and not let early success affect my mindset.



# 介绍下你的家人

I come from a warm and loving family. My mom loves exploring different recipes and cooking for me. Her cooking might not be top-notch in my opinion, but whenever I eat at school, I can’t help but miss the taste of home.
   My dad is someone who enjoys sharing his wisdom — always patiently teaching me things. Though honestly, some of his ideas was a bit old-fashioned.
   I also have a little dog who’s been with me since I was in primary school. it had became an irreplaceable part of our family.



我来自一个温馨的小家庭。妈妈喜欢研究各种菜肴做给我吃，虽然她的厨艺在我心中算不上顶尖，但每次在学校吃饭的时候，我总会不由自主地想念家里的味道。爸爸是个爱讲道理的人，时常语重心长地给我“传道授业”，只是他那些理论有时候多少有点“年代感”。家里还有一条从我小学起就陪伴我的小狗，早已成了我们家不可或缺的一份子



# 介绍下你的家乡

I’m from Wuhu, a small and peaceful city in Anhui Province. There are many parks located between mountains and rivers, offering great places for people to relax and unwind.

It’s the kind of place where life moves at a slower pace. Unlike big cities where everything feels rushed and crowded, Wuhu has less traffic, fewer crowds, and a more laid-back atmosphere.

At the same time, I don't become a bookworm, I made many friends and traveled to many places, I balanced my study with a rich and meaningful life.



# 你为什么没有科研经历

To be honest, I used to think that research was something mainly for graduate students, and that as an undergraduate, my main job was to build a strong foundation.

By the time I realized that it was possible—and valuable—for undergraduates to get involved in research, it was already a bit late.

# 相比于其他同学，你的核心竞争力是什么

I believe my strength lie in Strong algorithmic(ˈælɡəˌrɪðəmɪk) thinking and problem-solving ability, I am able to designing optimized solutions, analyzing complex logic, and applying algorithms to practical challenges in both academic and project 
   I also think a strong inner is my strength. During the graduate recommendation process, I faced many setbacks and rejections due to my relatively modest undergraduate background. However, I never gave up. I took every challenge as motivation to improve myself. This experience strengthened my mental toughness(ˈtəfnəs) and convinced me that in future research, no matter how difficult the journey is, I will stay committed and keep moving forward.


 在算法方面，我坚持长期练习，至今已累计完成近3000道算法题，具备较强的问题建模和解决能力，也锻炼了我在复杂情境下保持冷静、迅速找出解法的能力。
 在个人品质上，我是一个内心非常坚定的人。在保研过程中，由于本科背景并不突出，我曾多次遭遇质疑与拒绝，但我始终没有放弃，而是更加努力地完善自己，争取每一个机会。这段经历不仅锤炼了我的心理素质，也让我更加相信：无论未来科研之路多么艰难，我都能坚持到底，持续进步。

On the other hand, it tells the stories of many different people, so I can learn from their successes and understand the reasons behind their failures.



# 你最喜欢的电影是什么

My favorite movie is Resident Evil. I find the zombie setting really interesting, and the idea of surviving in a world full of zombies is both thrilling and intense. It keeps me fully engaged the whole time. Sometimes, I can’t help but imagine how I would survive if I were in a world full of zombies



# 本科期间学到了什么

During my undergraduate studies, I built a solid foundation by studying core courses such as operating systems, databases, and computer networks. I also enhanced my practical and team skills through project development and programming competitions.



# 你最喜欢的运动

My favorite sport is badminton. Unlike football, which requires a lot of running and preparation, badminton is much more relaxed — all you need is a partner and a reasonably open space. It’s simple, convenient, and a great way for me to unwind in my free time.

我最喜欢的运动是羽毛球。相比足球那样需要很多人、奔跑激烈、准备繁琐，羽毛球更轻松随意，只需要两个人和一块差不多的空地就能打起来，既方便又解压，是我课余放松的首选。



# 有人提出了反对意见你会怎么做

I believe open-minded communication is important, so I try to stay calm and explain my perspective clearly and understand their point of view. If their points make more sense, I’m happy to adjust. I focus on solving problems, not winning arguments.

如果有人反对我，我会先听清楚对方的观点，再表达自己的想法，理性讨论。如果对方更有道理，我也愿意接受。重点是解决问题，不是争输赢。

# 你平时是如何学习英语的

I usually build my vocabulary by memorizing words using apps or word lists. I also improve my reading and listening skills by going through English materials like short videos, speeches(ˈspiːtʃɪz). When I come across unfamiliar expressions, I write them down and review them regularly.

I chose computer science because it’s used everywhere these days – it’s literally changing the world and shaping the future. I want to master these skills to solve real problems and create cool stuff. Meanwhile, it also offers strong career prospects and competitive salaries, which makes it a practical and rewarding choice for the future.



# 说一下你的马拉松

It was an exhausting experience due to the early start and long hours of standing and waiting. I volunteered at the Chongqing Marathon as part of my efforts to earn extra credits for postgraduate recommendation. We gathered at 4:30 a.m. and arrived at the venue early. The event drew tens of thousands of participants and spectators, and I was deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of Chongqing citizens for sports. My duty was to assist with anti-doping procedures, supervising top finishers after the race to ensure they followed proper testing protocols. Unfortunately, the top eight runners were all from Africa, with only two Chinese athletes(ˈæθliːts) making it into the top ten.

我曾在重庆马拉松中担任志愿者，以此为保研加分。当天我们凌晨4:30集合，提前抵达比赛现场。比赛吸引了数万名选手和观众，我深刻感受到重庆市民对体育的热情。我的工作是协助兴奋剂检测，监督优胜选手赛后是否按流程进行检测。比较遗憾的是，前八名选手均来自非洲，只有两位中国选手进入前十。
